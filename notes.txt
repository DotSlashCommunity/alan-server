Simple Reminder Section

During the /login end-points, it takes a GET Method with parameters as
r -> roll and p -> phone, It then verifies stuff and returns an approp
e -> error and m -> message as JSON, representing if an error occoured
and if it did what part of the Server did that!

    m -> :
        a: already logged in
        l: locked question
        n: not logged in
        s: not present
        p: phone
        r: roll

    l -> locked question ?
